      <h3>Introduction!</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! Again In theis blog I will be going over a brief react intalation
        and file explanation. Then I will explane my demo and the jurney of
        creating it. After i will share my conclusion on react.
      </p>

      <h3>React Set up</h3>
      <p>
        First you will need to install node.js simply go to there web site and
        install
        <img src="Photos/node istallation page .png" alt="pic" /> <br />
        <br />
        Then open your terminal and type the following command - npm create
        vite@4.1.0 or npm create vite@latest Then input y then name your new
        project then select react. after which you will get another promp to
        select a lenguage. It should look like the following picture
        <img src="Photos/install vite .png" alt="pic" /> <br />
        <br />

        The next step is to follow the commands given to you it should look like
        the picture below.
        <img src="Photos/installed vite .png" alt="pic" /> <br />
        <br />

        The last command (npm run dev) this will launch the react project in its
        default state. the terminal should display the bottom picture.
        <img src="Photos/run dev in terminal.png" alt="pic" /> <br />
        <br />

        Then you can click the link and see your newly created react application
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="Photos/first react project page.png" alt="pic" /> <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <br />
      Finally you open the project file in the IDE of your choice and you are
      done! Next I just want to go over a guick overview of the files you will
      see since there are quite a few. <br />
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>
          The node modules folder this simply houses all the 3rd party
          libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
          The public folder is where the public assets of the website exist like
          images, video files etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          The src folder is self explanatory but the components for the
          application lie within hear.
        </li>
        <li>
          The package.json holds relevant information about the application like
          library used dependencies etc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />

      Below you can see all the files <br />
      <br />
      <div id="file">
        <img src="Photos/files.png" alt="pic" />
        <br />
      </div>
      <br />
      The html page is also self explanatory but the one notable thing is that
      there is a root div this is the container for our application. Then
      thereâ€™s the script tag that is the entry point to our application. Below
      we can see the root div and the script tag. <br />
      <br />
      <div id="index_img">
        <img src="Photos/index file .png" alt="pic" />
        <br />
      </div>

      <h3>How React Works</h3>
      <p>
        React uses a react element that is a java script object that is mapped
        to a a DOM element, this JS object is just a representation of the DOM
        in memory So in genral terms React keeps a loose representation of the
        real DOM (Virtual DOM) in memory kinda like a copy. <br>
  
         Unlike the real DOM
        the virtual is easy to make it dosnt take much resources, this helps
        because whenever we change a component React will create a new virtual
        DOM then it will compare the previous component and children to the new
        virtual DOM then figure out whats changed after which it updates that
        part in real DOM. React basically keeps a reccord of the old DOM and the
        real DOM then compares it with the newest DOM ie the virtual DOM then
        updates accordinly to keep everythin in synch this is why the name
        React is so fitting it reacts to your changes.  <br>
      
        Before react developers
        had to manipulate the real DOM by adding event liseners and quearys to
        the DOM it was compleatly hands on but with react its done
        automatically.
