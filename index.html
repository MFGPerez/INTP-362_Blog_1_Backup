      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello!, my name is Marcel Gallardo Perez im born and raised in Calgary,
        AB Canada and am currently 25 Years old. <br />

        I am in my 3rd year of the Information techlology program at SAIT.

      <h3>Introduction!</h3>
      <p>Hello! in this blog i will be going over the why not much of the how, so there will be not a lot of detail on the how of react such as the 
        set up, how it works, what tools are available (functions, tips, tricks). This will explane what react is and why people are so fond of it and my opinons on react so far. 

      </p>
      <h3>What I thought react was</h3>
      <p>I first heard about react from my group members in 2 year, one of my group members did a web application using react. 
        He showed us a polished website and tolled us how much simpler react is compared to base java script or JSTL/JSP/servlets. 
        I thought from what he said it was a seperate language that was used for web development along with its own UI and built in methods/functions. 

      </p>

      <h3>What react actually is</h3>
      <p>React is a open source java script library initially developed by facebook specifically a developer named Jordan Walke. Facebook developed react to be a easy and fast way to develop UI and web applications 
        by using significantly less code compared to base java script. A key consept of react is simplyfying the design of UI and web apps into managable pices that can be reused.</p>

      <h3>How does is work?</h3>
      <p>In react there are things called components we can think of these as blocks of code containing a pice of the web application. 
        like a navagation bar would be one component, a profile section would be another component. In these components there are sub components ex if we go back to 
        the profile component there would be a picture component and a details component that both controll the look, interactivity, and changes that can be made to them. like 
        clicking on the profile picture to bring up a larger image or expand the about me paragraph in the details component. 
        This can be viewed as each component having a hierarchy like a sub class in java you have the super class and the sub classes in this case the superclass is the profile component and the sub classes 
        are the picture component and the details component. 
        To further hammer this home i personally like to imagine each part of a web app as its own block and each block has a diferent color almost like lego. 
        This also shows how react is reusable with these blocks of components we can take them and add the blocks to different applications, we can take a nav bar and plug it into another app 
        and we would just need the component file we do not need the html and the css files along with the java script files to try and fit it into another application. 
        It is not seemless and im sure it takes some light modifying but even so it is much much simpler than the ladder option. <br>
        <br>
        Ide like to chow you a image of a component in visual studio code 
        <img src="Photos/component - react.png" alt="pic" /><br>
        <br>
        ex what comp is
      </p>

      <h3>How is react better than other tools?</h3>
      <p>From what ive seen and reserched react seems to be "better" all techlology is a little subjective in my opinion but from what i gather 
        The reason react is looked at with a lot of positivity is its re-usability and flexibility. Developer teams are not to fond of rigid rules and ristrictions so react not 
        having strict rules for code convetions or file organization means teams that use react are free to set there own standards for code as well as freedom to use react however they want to. <br>

        <br>
        Developers can use react for a simple button or for an entire application its up to the developer. In addition to this you can integrate components into an exsisting web application 
      to do this however you will need a content dilivery network 

      </p>

      <h3>My plan moving forward with react</h3>
